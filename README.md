# electric-car-traveller
An Algorithm related to weighted undirected graphs that computes list of stops an electric car requires to recharge from source to destination.
If car has minimum charging then car should stop at charging station for recharge and if in case charging station is broken then car should have at least sufficient charging to travel back to the previous city for recharge.
The program takes input for Capacity, number of cities and the distance between the cities and calculates the required stops the car needs to take.
